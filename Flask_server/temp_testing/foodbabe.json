)\n\u2026 these options are way , way better than conventional Valentine \u2019 s treats , and you can find them at natural foods grocery stores or online ( links provided below ) .\nIf you \u2019 re wondering what kind of chocolate I personally like to eat , my favorite organic chocolate brands include : Please spread the word and ask your friends and loved ones to start seeking out safer candy !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these candy swaps , please share this post with them .\nThis Valentine \u2019 s Day , I want you to know how much you mean to me and to all of us here at Food Babe .\nWe truly love you so much for being on our team and helping us change the food system .\nWe \u2019 ve got a lot in store for you this year that we know you \u2019 re going to love .\nI can \u2019 t wait until you see what \u2019 s coming .",

    "content": "I have great news for you today : Truvani \u2019 s Plant Based Omega is finally available !\nThis new supplement can help support brain health , heart health , and overall wellness within your body .\nThere are over 30,000 studies supporting the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet .\nBut , when we set out to develop our omega supplement , we faced a few obstacles .\nWe wanted to create a product that : \u2022 Uses organic ingredients when they are available \u2022 Is void of any toxins whenever possible You \u2019 d think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not .\nThis product wasn \u2019 t easy to make .\nAnd it almost didn \u2019 t happen .\nYou see , when we started developing our omega supplement last year , we ran into big problems .\nEven though you can \u2019 t certify plant-based omega supplements as organic , some organic supplements use sunflower oil to help deliver nutrients and keep the product stable .\nSunflower oil can be organic , and for some reason manufacturers refused to replace their non-organic sunflower oil with organic sunflower oil .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their response : \u201c There \u2019 s no demand for it.\n\u201d Meaning they wouldn \u2019 t use it .\nAnd I wasn \u2019 t going to compromise .\nNot for this product , or any product with the Truvani label .\nSo , we put the product on hold immediately .\nEven though it created some major headaches , it was worth it .\nWe built Truvani into a brand people can trust .\nAnd saying NO to bad ingredients is our motto .\nWe didn \u2019 t lose hope .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , after a year , we finally found one .\nSo , our new product is now possible\u2026 and it \u2019 s amazing .\nThese little details are what makes Truvani products bar none .\nSo , if you ever thought about trying an Omega 3 supplement , I highly suggest you check it out .\nPlus , since it \u2019 s brand new , we are offering up to 25 % off .\nWe like to reward our most loyal customers with the best possible pricing .\nTruvani \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try at special launch pricing here Truvani \u2019 s Plant Based Omega is made with responsibly-sourced algal oil , delivered in a banded capsule that is carrageenan-free and gelatin-free .\n( Many Omegas come in soft-gels .\nSoft-gels often have carrageenan .\nSometimes they don \u2019 t call it carrageenan and disguise it as \u201c seaweed extract.\n\u201d Truvani doesn \u2019 t use soft-gels ) .\nIt gets better , too .\nThe # 1 complaint for omega supplements is \u201c Fish burps.\n\u201d Because most omega supplements are made from fish oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is plant-based .\nPlus , we use a water-based extraction process , so no chemical solvents involved .\nThis process removes impurities , too .\nWhich means no nasty fish burps .\nNo gross smell .\nJust a clean-tasting , shelf-stable omega-3 supplement that you \u2019 re going to love .\nI will always put up a fight to make sure each product meets the high-quality Truvani standards .\nEven if it means we delay a product .\nOr cancel it altogether .\nLuckily we could make this product happen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .\nP.S .\nAre you as excited about this new supplement as I am ?\nTell me in the comments below !",

    "content": "We are going through a crazy time .\nUndoubtedly the craziest time in my lifetime .\nI \u2019 ve been having long , personal conversations with my friends about everything going on , doing what we can to build each other up .\nAnd many of them expressed frustration about one thing\u2026 Ever since the quarantines started they \u2019 ve been drinking more alcohol\u2026way more than they normally do .\nWhat used to be maybe a weekly ( or monthly ) occurrence , is seriously becoming an every night of the week habit that is getting out of control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re bored and completely stressed out \u2013 and turning to booze to make them feel better .\nI hate to be a buzzkill , but honestly , I have to say it\u2026 .\nDrinking all the time , especially during this crisis , is one of the worst things you can do right now .\nYou are relying on something that ( ironically ) is horrible for your health because you are feeling stressed out .\nThere are better ways to handle this situation .\nI know you probably don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out .\nThose nightly \u201c Quarantinis \u201d are detrimental to your immune system .\nYou \u2019 ve heard alcohol is bad for your liver \u2013 but that \u2019 s not the only organ it \u2019 s affecting .\nDrinking too much alcohol disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria your gut .\nYou see , we all have a garden of bacteria living in our intestines ( 1 ) , which is vitally important to the health of our immune system as a whole ( 2 ) .\nThe \u201c good \u201d bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) .\nWhen you drink \u2013 you create an imbalance in your gut bacteria ( 6 ) \u2013 which in turn compromises your body \u2019 s ability to fight infections ( 7 ) .\nFurther down the line , this can lead to leaky gut syndrome ( 8 ) \u2013 which creates tiny little holes in our digestive system organs that leak out the good bacteria we need to stay healthy and keep our immune system strong .\nWhen you drink , certain white blood cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense against infections essentially get shut down and are only about \u00bc as effective as fighting viruses as they usually are ( 9 ) .\nIt is a major blow to your natural immune defenses .\nHeavy drinking can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well , because it impairs your body \u2019 s ability to absorb nutrients ( 10 ) .\nWithout necessary nutrients , you \u2019 re more susceptible to infections and won \u2019 t be able to heal as quickly .\nAnd if all this isn \u2019 t enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specifically increase the risk of respiratory infections ( 11 ) , such as pneumonia and ARDS .\nKnowing what we know so far about COVID-19 and how it affects the respiratory system\u2026 do you think those nightly drinks are worth the risk ?\nIt \u2019 s not just the alcohol that \u2019 s shutting off your immune system .\nMost alcoholic drinks are filled with unhealthy ingredients that are sabotaging you .\nWhat \u2019 s in your booze ( besides booze ) ?\nEver wonder what makes Bailey \u2019 s Irish Cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tropically blue ?\nWhat makes Malibu Rum so sweet , or what gives Captain Morgan its golden hue ?\nYou may never know because ingredient labeling on beer , wine , or liquor is not required by the FDA .\nThe alcohol industry has lobbied for years against ingredient labels because they don \u2019 t want you to know what you \u2019 re drinking .\nAs a result , we know more about what \u2019 s in a bottle of Windex than we do about the world \u2019 s most popular drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ) to tell us what \u2019 s in their beer , the two largest beer manufacturers began listing their ingredients online ( 13 ) \u2013 but there is still a lot we do not know .\nMy research for The Food Babe Way uncovered a slew of unlabeled additives ( 14 ) and crazy ingredients you \u2019 d never guess you were drinking .\nTo give you a recap , this might be lurking in your favorite drink : \u2022 None Roundup Weedkiller / Pesticides ( contaminants found in some beer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular drinks\u2026 NOTE ABOUT WHITE CLAW : White Claw says their full ingredient list is \u201c proprietary \u201d \u2013 which means it is a secret .\n\u201c The alcohol in White Claw Hard Seltzer comes from fermented sugars derived from malted gluten-free grains \u201d \u2013 which could mean corn syrup , but who knows ?\nThey haven \u2019 t responded to an inquiry from my team to clarify this yet .\nLiquors don \u2019 t list ingredients , but what are you mixing them with ?\nThe decision to drink alcohol is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne , and tequila every now and then .\nWhen I do , I make the best choices I can .\nHaving alcohol is not a judgment call that any of us should make for others , unless excessive drinking is ruining someone \u2019 s health , family , and personal life .\nThe important thing is to be educated about alcohol , what \u2019 s in it , how much should be consumed , and whether you feel it \u2019 s something you want to have in your lifestyle .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booze , there are healthier and more effective ways to handle your stress .\nSo , set down that cocktail and let me show you some strategies that work for me to keep my sanity , which I \u2019 m sure could help you as well .\n\u2022 Stop going down the news rathole .\nThe news is overwhelming right now and this can cause a lot of stress .\nAnd you know what ?\nStress is a huge immunity killer !\nSo do yourself a favor and use this time to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watch movies at home , cook together , and take time to relax and de-stress .\nIf you live alone , set up online video chats with your friends and family to stay connected .\nLimit yourself to checking in with the news once or twice a day to stay informed \u2013 and then put it away !\n\u2022 Write it all down and practice gratitude : Start jotting down your feelings about all that is happening in the world and how you are personally handling it .\nTell your own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone else .\nExpressing yourself in writing is very therapeutic .\nResearch has shown that journaling helps people heal during times of stress and trauma ( 15 ) .\nAlso write out what you are grateful for each day .\nThere is always much to be thankful for and when you start paying attention to it , magic starts to happen .\n\u2022 Exercise more , and regularly .\nStress hormones like cortisol are reduced when you exercise regularly ( 16 ) \u2013 plus you release endorphins , which are \u201c feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel happy .\nEven if the gym is closed , you can still do workout videos at home without any special equipment ( besides perhaps a wifi connection or a DVD ) .\nYou can also go for bike rides , jogs , an long walks outdoors .\n\u2022 Start meditating .\nThis a is a majorly effective tool to decrease your stress levels ( 17 ) , and also reduces your chances of getting sick because chronic stress leads to bodily inflammation , which makes you more susceptible to illness .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 and your brain is intimately connected to your organs and the immune system .\nYou don \u2019 t need any equipment and there are several free guided meditations available online if meditation is new to you .\nThe practice of yoga is related to this as well and is another great option .\n\u2022 Get some sun .\nWhen you expose your skin to the sun , you help your body produce more Vitamin D \u2013 the \u201c sunshine vitamin \u201d , which supports a happy mood .\nThe simple act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress and increase well being ( 18 ) .\n\u2022 Make sleep a priority .\nThis is a never-ending cycle .\nIf you are stressed out , it might keep you up at night .\nAnd when you don \u2019 t get enough sleep you get cranky and more anxious \u2013 leading to MORE stress .\nDo whatever you can to get more sleep to break this cycle .\nIf anxiety is keeping you up at night , try taking some magnesium or melatonin .\nGet some sun exposure in the morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural melatonin production at night .\n\u2022 Take stress-supporting supplements .\nAdaptogens such as ashwagandha and maca help to support a happy mood and sleep quality .\nThese may make it easier for you to deal with all the stressors in your life .\n\u2022 Call up a friend or loved one .\nIt \u2019 s really important to stay socially connected .\nIt \u2019 s been shown that when you have a social support system around you , you are less likely to feel depressed or anxious ( 19 ) .\nSharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and relieves your stress like none other !\nI you can , use Skype , FaceTime , Zoom , or some other video sharing app , so you can see each other too !\nWhat are you doing to relieve stress during this crazy time

    "title": "Peanut Butter & Almond Butter To Never Buy Again + My Top Brands (Ultimate Nut Butter Buying Guide)",
    "content": "One of my favorite indulgences is almond butter .\nI eat it almost every day\u2026 I \u2019 ll put a scoop in my morning oats , in my smoothies , and spread it on celery .\nWhen I was growing up , we always had a jar of Peter Pan Peanut Butter in the house .\nTo me , that sweet heavily-processed spread was the only real peanut butter there was \u2013 and I really didn \u2019 t realize until well into my 20 \u2019 s that there are MUCH healthier options out there .\nToday , the nut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections in the grocery store .\nYou \u2019 ve got creamy , crunchy , no-stir , stir , reduced fat , sweetened , unsweetened , palm oil , no palm oil , raw , roasted , natural , and organic .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that one of most popular questions I get is what brand of nut butter I use .\nIn this post , I \u2019 m going to walk you through practically every brand of nut butter that you \u2019 ll see on the shelf and tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute first thing I look at is the ingredient list .\nNut butter should only contain nuts ( and perhaps sea salt ) .\nFlip over all the major brands of nut butter and read the ingredients .\nIt \u2019 s common to find hydrogenated oils ( soybean and cottonseed ) or palm oil added , which is used to keep it from separating on the shelf and keeps it fresh without refrigeration .\nThis may be more convenient , but those heavily processed and refined oils are not good for your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find sugar added to nut butter , which is an ingredient that most people eat way too much of .\nIf you are eating nut butter on a regular basis , you especially want to make sure it is not sweetened .\nOccasionally , I may choose an organic nut butter that \u2019 s sweetened with coconut sugar ( such as JEM brand ) , but I would treat this as a dessert .\nMy everyday nut butter doesn \u2019 t contain any added sugars \u2013 just nuts !\nLet me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of peanut butter ( regular , Simply , and Natural ) that all contain white sugar and additional oils .\nOther popular brands such as Skippy , Peter Pan , and Reese \u2019 s are also filled with hydrogenated oils and white sugar .\nBarney Butter , Justin \u2019 s , and Jif Almond Butter may sound healthier , but they also add oils to their nut butters so that stirring isn \u2019 t required .\nThe oil in nuts naturally separate in the jar and float to the top , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time you use it .\nThis can be messy , but one trick I \u2019 ve found is to store an unopened jar upside down in your pantry .\nWhen you \u2019 re ready to open and use it , it is much easier to stir without making a mess because the oil has largely incorporated into the butter and settled at the bottom of the jar , instead of the top .\nAfter stirring , make sure to store the opened jar in your fridge .\nLook for Nut butters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t let the \u201c natural \u201d label guide you Some brands ( Adams , Smucker \u2019 s , Crazy Richards , Trader Joe \u2019 s , and Kirkland ) make nut butters with only nuts , but they are not certified organic .\nIt \u2019 s very important to choose organic nut butter because conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides .\nEspecially when it comes to peanuts because they are a legume ( not technically a nut ) and their pods grow underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed and concentrated .\nCouple that with the fact that peanuts are often rotated with cottonseed crops ( 1 ) ( the world \u2019 s most pesticide-ridden crop ) and you \u2019 ve got a breeding ground for massive pesticide contamination .\n( 2 ) Conventional almonds and peanuts can be contaminated with Piperonyl Butoxide ( 3 ) a pesticide ingredient that is classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen ( 4 ) and linked to liver damage .\nConventional almonds can also be contaminated with Chlorpyrifos ( 5 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 6 ) Glyphosate ( Roundup ) herbicide is used on conventional peanuts and nuts ( 7 ) \u2013 and it \u2019 s known to cause cancer ( 8 ) .\nProducts are usually not tested for these chemicals , but residues of glyphosate have been found in Skippy Natural Peanut Butter .\n( 9 ) The best nut butters are both Raw & Organic .\nThere are several organic brands with one ingredient ( which is good ) , but they are made with roasted nuts instead of raw nuts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuts are \u201c Raw \u201d on the label , it is safe to assume the nuts are roasted .\nRoasted nut butters taste really good , I \u2019 m not going to lie \u2013 but if you want to choose the best one , raw nuts are healthiest because\u2026 \u2022 Roasting can damage the healthy fats that are found in nuts .\nOne of the greatest health benefits of nuts are the healthy polyunsaturated fats they contain , so you don \u2019 t want those destroyed !\nWhen nuts are roasted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fats can oxidize , a process that generates free radicals .\n( 10 ) .\nFree radicals are renegade molecules that damage cells in the body .\n\u2022 Oftentimes , \u201c roasted nuts \u201d are not actually roasted but fried in oils .\nThese oils end up in the finished product .\n\u2022 Roasted nuts may contain fewer antioxidants and nutrients like vitamin E which are prevalent in almonds .\n\u2022 Roasting at high temperatures may produce harmful substances like acrylamide , which is linked to cancer .\nWhen it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more tricky .\nRaw peanuts may be contaminated with Aspergillus flavus , a type of mold which produces the cancerous toxin aflatoxin .\n( 11 ) Roasting peanuts prohibits the production of aflatoxin and may also reduce aflatoxin content ( 12 ) \u2013 so roasting may make peanuts safer to eat .\nAlso , the fat found in peanuts is fairly heat resistant and less likely to oxidize .\n( 13 ) It \u2019 s rare to find raw peanut butter on the market , but you can make it at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. are pasteurized ( typically with steam if they are organic ) to destroy any pathogens such as salmonella .\nSo there are not any truly raw U.S. almonds , but they are not cooked to the extent of roasted almonds .\nBeware that if the almonds are NOT organic , they may be pasteurized with the toxic chemical propylene oxide \u2013 which is classified as a probable human carcinogen .\n( 14 ) Yet another reason to only choose organic !\nThree steps to finding the healthiest nut butter : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt ) \u2022 Is certified organic .\nLook for the USDA organic seal on the label .\n\u2022 The nuts and seeds are raw ( not roasted ) , with the exception of peanut butter .\nIt will say specifically on the jar that it is \u201c raw \u201d .\nSome brands make conventional and raw organic versions , so you need to be very careful when shopping .\nFor example , the brand MaraNatha makes conventional almond butters , but also has a raw organic version that I like .\nThe packaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the ingredient list is so important .\nMy picks for the best nut butters & seed butters : To make it super easy for you , here \u2019 s a list of brands that meet my criteria .\nI personally buy the Artisana Organics brand often \u2013 which is found in natural grocery stores and online .\nIf you have a nut allergy , I also listed my picks for seed butters .\nThis includes pumpkin seed butter , which many people find better tasting than sunflower seed butter .\nWant more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of EVERYTHING you \u2019 ll find in my pantry and
